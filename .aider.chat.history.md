The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update this file to describe the logo image you want to generate.
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values to match the new app description.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a stylized coin icon with a green arrow indicating a swap, set against a dark blue background. The coin icon is a simple circle with a white outline and a subtle gradient, and the arrow is a white curved arrow that loops around the coin, symbolizing a swap action. The background is a deep navy blue with a faint radial gradient to give depth. The overall design is clean, modern, and conveys the idea of efficient token swapping.
